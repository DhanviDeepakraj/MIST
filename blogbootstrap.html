Lined with shops, cafes, and historic buildings, this bustling yet charming thoroughfare is one of the main streets in old town Edinburgh.</p>

                                 <p>Situated practically in the middle of the Royal Mile, St. Giles Cathedral is a beautiful Gothic-style cathedral with intricate stonework. Now it doesn't quite compare to the cathedral in my home city of Cologne, Germany but it still pretty impressive. The crown-topped tower is older than the rest of the church, and has become an icon of Edinburgh. Open to the public daily, the interior truly captivates. The stunning stained glass windows and intricate woodwork create a lovely atmosphere. I also especially liked all the banner flags with different state and house sigils on them. You might even catch live music inside!</p>

                                 <p>One of the most recognizable buildings on the Edinburgh skyline is the Scott Monument. The Neo-Gothic style tower shoots 200 feet up into the air and can be seen from around the city. It is dedicated to famed Scottish author Sir Walter Scott, known for his novels like "Waverley" and "Ivanhoe." His work played a pivotal role in shaping Scottish literature and preserving Scottish cultural heritage. The Scott Monument was erected in his honor following his death in 1832. Inside the monument, visitors can find a statue of Sir Walter Scott, surrounded by 64 smaller statues depicting characters from his novels.</p>

                                 <p>Perched dramatically atop Castle Rock, Edinburgh Castle is THE must-visit attraction in Edinburgh. It is a fantastic example of a medieval castle, absolutely dominating the skyline of Edinburgh. This iconic landmark has played a pivotal role in Scotland's history and stands as a symbol of the nation's resilience and heritage. The castle dates back to at least the 12th century, truly standing the test of time through wars, unrest and all sorts of other unsavory things in Scottish history.</p>

This grand boulevard is named after the sons of King George III – Prince George (later King George IV) and Prince Frederick – and runs parallel along the southern edge of the city's New Town. The street itself was designed in the 18th century as part of the New Town's urban planning, with a deliberate focus on providing unobstructed views of the Edinburgh Castle.</p>

                                 <p>The palace adjoins Holyrood Abbey, and the gardens are set within Holyrood Park. The King's Gallery was converted from existing buildings at the western entrance to the palace and was opened in 2002 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.

                                    King Charles III spends one week in residence at Holyrood at the beginning of summer, where he carries out a range of official engagements and ceremonies. The 16th-century historic apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the State Apartments, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public throughout the year, except when members of the royal family are in residence. The palace also serves as the official residence of the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland during the annual meeting of the General Assembly.</p>
