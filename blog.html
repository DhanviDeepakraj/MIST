     <h1><u>Best things to see in Edinburgh</u></h1>
     <ol>
        <li><i><h2>Royal Mile</h2></i></li>
        <img src="https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/location/5c10eaaf07012.jpeg/68.jpg">
     <p>Running approximately one mile between Edinburgh Castle and Holyroodhouse, the Royal Mile is effectively named – it is a mile-long stretch of road that connects two royal residences. Lined with shops, cafes, and historic buildings, this bustling yet charming thoroughfare is one of the main streets in old town Edinburgh.</p>
     <p>From street performers to local artisans, the Royal Mile provides a sensory experience that captures the essence of Edinburgh. Be sure to explore the narrow alleyways (called closes in Edinburgh) that branch off the main street. Before cars, these were the residential streets. Nowadays, there are still apartments but also plenty of restaurants, shops and museums. Wandering through will reveal hidden gems.</p>
     <br>
        <li><i><h2>St Giles Cathedral</h2></i></li>

        <p>Situated practically in the middle of the Royal Mile, St. Giles Cathedral is a beautiful Gothic-style cathedral with intricate stonework. Now it doesn't quite compare to the cathedral in my home city of Cologne, Germany but it still pretty impressive. The crown-topped tower is older than the rest of the church, and has become an icon of Edinburgh. Open to the public daily, the interior truly captivates. The stunning stained glass windows and intricate woodwork create a lovely atmosphere. I also especially liked all the banner flags with different state and house sigils on them. You might even catch live music inside! </p>
        <br>
        <li><i><h2>Edinburgh Castle</h2></i></li>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSn6mSHuo2arDNDn86DXpmF_7MKmObYrnUgUA&s" height="300">
        <p>Perched dramatically atop Castle Rock, Edinburgh Castle is THE must-visit attraction in Edinburgh. It is a fantastic example of a medieval castle, absolutely dominating the skyline of Edinburgh. This iconic landmark has played a pivotal role in Scotland's history and stands as a symbol of the nation's resilience and heritage. The castle dates back to at least the 12th century, truly standing the test of time through wars, unrest and all sorts of other unsavory things in Scottish history.</p>
        <p>You need to buy tickets to visit Edinburgh Castle in advance with a specific time slot. Although there are open tickets available each day, they sell out quickly. Additionally, the castle hosts lots of major events throughout the year, such as the Military Tattoo festival. Once inside the castle. you can explore its ancient stone walls and grand halls.<i>Don't miss the following things inside in the castle:</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Crown Jewels: The Crown Room houses the Crown, Sceptre, and Sword of State for Scotland as well as the Stone of Destiny. These are the oldest crown jewels in the British Isles.</li>
            <li>St. Margaret's Chapel: This small chapel within the castle's walls is the oldest surviving building in Edinburgh, dating back to the 12th century.</li>
            <li>The Great Hall: Built by James IV in the early 16th century, the Great Hall is a grand and imposing space that was once the center of royal feasts and gatherings.</li>
            <li>One O'Clock Gun: The tradition of firing the One O'Clock Gun, a time signal for ships in the Firth of Forth, has been ongoing since 1861 and is still carried out daily today.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><i><h2>Scott Monument</h2></i></li>

        <p>One of the most recognizable buildings on the Edinburgh skyline is the Scott Monument. The Neo-Gothic style tower shoots 200 feet up into the air and can be seen from around the city. It is dedicated to famed Scottish author Sir Walter Scott, known for his novels like "Waverley" and "Ivanhoe." His work played a pivotal role in shaping Scottish literature and preserving Scottish cultural heritage. The Scott Monument was erected in his honor following his death in 1832. Inside the monument, visitors can find a statue of Sir Walter Scott, surrounded by 64 smaller statues depicting characters from his novels.</p>
        <br>
        <li><i><h2>Walk Princess Street</h2></i></li></ol>

        <p>Princes Street is one of the city's most iconic and bustling thoroughfares, offering a unique blend of shopping, history, and stunning views. This grand boulevard is named after the sons of King George III – Prince George (later King George IV) and Prince Frederick – and runs parallel along the southern edge of the city's New Town. The street itself was designed in the 18th century as part of the New Town's urban planning, with a deliberate focus on providing unobstructed views of the Edinburgh Castle.</p>
        <p>Princes Street Gardens lie between Princes Street and the Old Town. These gardens provide a picturesque green space where locals and visitors can relax amid the hustle and bustle of the city. I find it especially lively on a sunny day or during the Fringe festival when lots of people are lounging on the lawn. Plus, the gardens offer splendid views of the Edinburgh Castle, the Scott Monument, and the iconic Balmoral Hotel.</p>
